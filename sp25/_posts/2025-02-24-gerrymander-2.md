## Reading

1. Kedron, P. and Holler, J. (2024).  Validation and Verification of Applied GIS Research. The Geographic Information Science & Technology Body of Knowledge (2024 Edition), John P. Wilson (ed.). DOI: [10.22224/gistbok/2024.1.13](https://doi.org/10.22224/gistbok/2024.1.13).

## Study possibilities

- Search for and propose a study applying geospatial analysis. It should have available data and be feasible to implement in R or Python
- Make the Makuyuni Wildlife Corridor in Tanzania fully reproducible in R
- Complete Chakraborty replication with new data (pre-analysis plan and preliminary work [has been done](https://github.com/HEGSRR/RPl-Chakraborty-2022))
- Reproduce and update our prior studies on spatial analysis of COVID-19. These were written in separate scripts, and not in our modernized compendium template. They use sptial statistical methods. <https://github.com/HEGSRR/RPr-Saffary-2020>, <https://github.com/HEGSRR/RPr-Vijayan-2020>, or <https://github.com/HEGSRR/RPr-Mollalo-2020>
- Reproduce any studies on [CyberGISX](https://cybergisxhub.cigi.illinois.edu/notebooks/) / [I-GUIDE](https://iguide.illinois.edu/platform/) / [Hydroshare](https://www.hydroshare.org/) 
- Propose another idea!
