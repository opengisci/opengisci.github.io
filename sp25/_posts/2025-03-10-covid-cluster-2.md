## Goals and Expectations

- Implement your analysis plan using R
- Discuss your results and conclude the study
- Knit the study report to `html` format and save to the `docs` folder 
- Use what you learn from Kedron and Holler (2024) and Schmitt (1978) to frame your goals and interpret your findings
- Create a version `release` of your compendium on GitHub once the analysis is complete and the report is rendered
- Write a blog post to highlight your findings and link to the report
