## Goals and Expectations

The overarching goal is to finalize the analysis plan.

- Planned deviations
- Review of the paper's context, significance, and methods
- Discussion of implications: what if the reproduction succeeds at generating consistent results? What if it does not?
- Identification of required computational environment / software packages
- Outline or even draft code
- Knit the analysis plan to `html` 
- Update the project `readme.md` and `LICENSE` files, and documentation of `procedure_index.csv`, `data_index.csv`, and `data/metadata`.
- Create a version `release` of your compendium on GitHub prior to analyzing any data and commit a version of the repository prior to analyzing data.
- Enable GitHub pages on the repository
- Draft a very short blog post linking to your proposed study release and highlighting your interest in the study.

As part of your preparations, you may want to identify and run some tutorials or vignettes that illustrate the methods you will need for the study.
Spin this up in separate `Learn-` repositories as we have done with these:

- [Learn-PCA](https://github.com/opengisci/Learn-PCA)
- [Learn-GEE](https://github.com/opengisci/Learn-GEE)
- [Learn-OSMnx](https://github.com/opengisci/Learn-OSMnx)
