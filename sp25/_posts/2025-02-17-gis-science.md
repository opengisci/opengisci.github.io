## Discussion and Blog

In preparation for class discussion, please prepare a blog-style reflection/position statement, which you will post on a GitHub site in the afternoon lab.
Specifically, you might reflect on:
- What is **science** and how does a **lack of reproducibility** impact **scientific knowledge production**? Do you have any prior experience or knowledge of irreproducibility or questionable research practices in science?
- Which category of **"GIS as Science"** most applies to your **personal experience thus far** using and studying GIS? Do those forms of GIS count as **"science"**?
- Which themes of **GIS Discourse** have attracted you to the technology or made you feel uneasy about it? Have your instructors or mentors made any arguments similar to the four themes, or have you made them yourself in conversations with friends and family?

### Three Positions on GIS as Science (Wright et al 1997)

1. GIS is a Scientific Tool
2. GIS is Toolmaking for Science
3. GIS is a Science

### Four themes of GIS Discourse (St. Martin and Wing 2007)

1. Singular technology
2. Progressing along a linear path
3. Inherently expansive and growing
4. Universally applicable

## 2023 was the Year of Open Science

The White House announced new actions to [advance open and equitable research](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/news-updates/2023/01/11/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-new-actions-to-advance-open-and-equitable-research/), but the new White House took that offline. For now, [Science.gov](https://open.science.gov/) appears to remain online.
