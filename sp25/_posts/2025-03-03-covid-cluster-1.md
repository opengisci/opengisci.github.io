## Goals and Expectations

- Based on reading alone, draw a workflow diagram representing your best guess at Chakraborty's research design.
- Create a reproducible compendium for reproducing the study and add data provided by the author.
- Draft an analysis plan as an *orgininal study* for implementing the study up to the point of defining *clusters* to be used in GEE (generalized estimating equation) models.
- Convert the analysis plan into a *reproduction study*, including the purpose of the reproduction study, any planned devations from the prior study and methods for comparing results
- Knit the analysis plan to html 
- Create a version `release` of your compendium on GitHub prior to analyzing any data and commit a version of the repository prior to analyzing data.

## Reading

- Chakraborty, J. 2021. Social inequities in the distribution of COVID-19: An intra-categorical analysis of people with disabilities in the U.S. *Disability and Health Journal* 14 (1):101007. DOI: [10.1016/j.dhjo.2020.101007](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dhjo.2020.101007).

## Resources

- You may use [Draw.io](https://draw.io) or similar software for workflow diagrams.
- Use [Draw.io](https://draw.io) to draw a workflow diagram representing your understanding of the research design, or draw neatly by hand or with a tablet.
