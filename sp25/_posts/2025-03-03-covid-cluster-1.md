## Goals and Expectations

**Before Class**

- Based on reading alone, draw a workflow diagram representing your best guess at Chakraborty's research design. You will need a digital version of the workflow for inclusion in your repository, whether drawn digitally or scanned.
- I suggest printing the article or using Zotero to highlight three types of clues with three colors:
  - Data sources and characteristics thereof
  - Methods and analysis
  - Intermediary and final results that could be compared with a reproduction study
- It is unlikley that you will be familiar with all of the methods. At this stage, it is OK to document a method as one "step" in analysis and take notes on *context clues* about how that method works.

**During Class**

- Create a reproducible compendium for reproducing the study and add data provided by the author.
- Draft an analysis plan as an *orgininal study* for implementing the study up to the point of defining *clusters* to be used in GEE (generalized estimating equation) models.
- Convert the analysis plan into a *reproduction study*, including the purpose of the reproduction study, any planned devations from the prior study and methods for comparing results
- Knit the analysis plan to html 
- Update the project `readme.md` and `LICENSE` files, and documentation of `procedure_index.csv`, `data_index.csv`, and `data/metadata`.
- Create a version `release` of your compendium on GitHub prior to analyzing any data and commit a version of the repository prior to analyzing data.

## Reading
