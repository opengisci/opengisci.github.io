## Welcome to Open Source Geographic Information Science!
[Middlebury College](http://www.middlebury.edu) [Geography](http://www.middlebury.edu/academics/geog) [Course](http://www.middlebury.edu/academics/geog/courses) [GEOG0323](https://catalog.middlebury.edu/courses/view/catalog/catalog%2FMCUG/course/course%2FGEOG0323)

## Contact and Availability

- Email: josephh@middlebury.edu
- Office Hour Spaces: McCardell Bicentennial Hall office (634) or GIS labs (632, 640 or 641)
- Office Hour Times: Tues 1:00&ndash;3:00 or by appointment
- Lecture: Tues/Thurs 11:15&ndash;12:30 in McCardell Bicentennial Hall 538
- Lab: Thurs 1:30&ndash;4:15 in BiHall 632

For assistance outside of office hours, your resources include:
1. The Issues or Wiki for the Git repository we are working on
2. Classmates
3. Documentation, Issues, Forums, or Support/FAQs for the data or software we are using. These resources will be announced and linked in each course topic.
4. [Stack Exchange](https://gis.stackexchange.com/) or similar
5. Only *private* or *confidential* concerns should be sent to email. Conceptual and technical questions should be discussed in the Issues feature or documented in the Wiki feature for the relevant Git repository.

## Major Learning Goals

- Practice **reproducible open science** in geographic research using *open source GIS*.
- Learn research design and research methods in geography through **reproducing**,  **reanalyzing**, and **replicating** prior research.
- **Critique** and **improve** upon prior research by studying and applying knowledge of the **nature of geographic information** and **analytical methods**. We will focus on fundamentals of data standards, metadata, error, uncertainty, and geographic threats to validity.
-	**Communicate** research effectively with **research compendia**, consisting of research plans and reports, data, code, and results in the form of interactive and static maps, graphs, and tables. Compile accomplishments into a **public research portfolio** on GitHub pages.

### Minor Learning Goals

- Solve problems individually and through collaboration as pairs, groups, and a whole class.
-	Survey [FOSS4G](https://foss4g.org/) (Free and Open Source for Geospatial) and [OSGEO](https://www.osgeo.org/) (Open Source Geospatial Foundation) in terms of the landscape of organizations and projects, research applications, and (radically) unique political economy of knowledge production.
-	Creatively apply FOSS4G/OSGEO to address compelling questions in human geography and problems in social and environmental sustainability, often integrating environmental and social data or tapping into big data sources.
-	Critically reflect on emerging opportunities and ethical dilemmas in open-source geographic information science.
-	Become competent and confident in conducting research, learning new methods, and overcoming errors, uncertainty, and technical difficulties. Learn to "debug" problems and teach yourself new techniques through structured experimentation.

## Expectations

- **Inclusivity**: Consciously and actively include yourself and others in learning, participation, collaboration, and discussions. Inclusivity may be achieved in part through [academic accomodations](https://www.middlebury.edu/office/disability-resource-center/accommodations-and-resources/academic-accommodations) and/or [student resources](https://www.middlebury.edu/office/teaching-learning-research/student-resources) for learning and research. Accommodations and correspondence about them are confidential.
- **Academic Honesty**: Open source and open science have a different ethos about intellectual property and its value than most of us are accustomed to. In the first two weeks of class, we will discuss and update our expectations for the [honor code and academic honesty](00c_honorcode.md) in a course focused on open science.
- **Deadlines**: You must always commit the progress that you have made on assignments by the assignment deadline. In case unforeseen challenges or delays have prevented full completion of an assignment, you are required to record the progress that you have made, describe the barrier(s) encountered and anything you have learned about it/them, and propose a solution.
- **End of Semester**: With many seniors in a spring course, it is not possible to accept late assignment submissions during or after finals week. [Incomplete grades](http://www.middlebury.edu/about/handbook/iv.-policies-for-the-institute/a.-academic-policies/a.6.-grades-credits-and-academic-policies/a.6.e.-incomplete-grades) can only be considered if extreme/unexpected circumstances arise in the final weeks of the semester and if the majority of assignments have already been satisfactorily completed.

## Student Work & Evaluation

- **Active Participation**
  - Maintain GitHub site & repositories
  - Review or react to readings in a *personal* blog post.
  - *Collaboratively* take notes on discussions or while studying papers, software, or data sources.
  - Preparation for and participation in discussions and debates
  - Asking well-formed questions in GitHub Issues and sharing solutions in GitHub Issues and Wikis.
  - Peer review of GitHub portfolios
  - Self-reflection on your learning and participation
- **GIScience Analyses**
  1. PostGIS OpenStreetMap Urban Resiliency
  1. R Climate Vulnerability
  1. R Twitter Disasters
  1. R COVID-19 Spatial Clusters and People with Disability
  1. Python/R Social Vulnerability
  1. Python COVID-19 Access to Healthcare Resources
  1. Independent Project
- **Final GitHub Profile**
  - Finalize revisions of a public GitHub Pages portfolio and set of GitHub repositories by **December 18**.

## Typical Rhythm

**Revisit after revising course lessons**

- Tuesday Preparation: Independent tutorial/workshop to introduce and practice new methods and/or contextual and critical reading related to upcoming topic.
- Tuesday Lecture: Discuss and debate findings from previous GIScience analysis and/or techniques and concepts for the upcoming GIScience analysis.
- Thursday Preparation: Reading publication to be reproduced or researching additional background on data sources or methods to be used.
- Thursday Lecture: Collaboratively discussing and understanding the research design, data, or methods to be applied during lab.
- Thursday Lab: Independently and collectively implementing GIScience research.

## Materials & Resources

There is no required textbook.

Digital materials will be provided on this site and in other repositories of the [opengisci GitHub Organization](https://github.com/opengisci), including a repository for [literature](https://github.com/opengisci/literature).

To complete the course, you must be willing to install a variety of free software and apply for/subscribe to a variety of free internet-based services, listed below. Required software will be available in our GIS labs, but can also be installed on your personal computer.

- [QGIS Version 3.28 LTR (or optionally a newer version) with GRASS](https://qgis.org/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [GitHub Account](https://github.com/)
- [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/)
- [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/)

Will we still use these?
- [Hour of Cyberinfrastructure](https://www.hourofci.org/)
- [CyberGISX](https://cybergisx.cigi.illinois.edu)
- [Twitter Developer](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply-for-access)


## General Expectations for GIScience Analyses

- Write up a summary and interpretation of the analysis.
- Include methods documentation to support full reproducibility. This is most easily achieved by having a model and/or code with good comments.
- Visualize results with maps and/or graphs.
- Publish the full package (write-up, methods documentation and visualization of results) to your GitHub pages *by Monday at noon*.
