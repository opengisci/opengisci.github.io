The purpose of this workshop is to reproduce Kang et al (2021) and in doing so, learn about methods for spatial accessibility analysis.

Kang, J. Y., A. Michels, F. Lyu, Shaohua Wang, N. Agbodo, V. L. Freeman, and Shaowen Wang. 2020. Rapidly measuring spatial accessibility of COVID-19 healthcare resources: a case study of Illinois, USA. *International Journal of Health Geographics* 19 (1):1â€“17. DOI:[10.1186/s12942-020-00229-x](https://ij-healthgeographics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12942-020-00229-x).

## Procedure

- **identify** an error, uncertain decision, or opportunity for improving reproducibility or study design. Everyone can contribute to the following on this reproduction:
- **choose** whether your modification should be placed in `02-COVID-19Acc-Original` (for something that aims to more completely or accurately match the original study) or `03-COVID-19Acc-Reanalysis` (for something that intends to modify the original study design)
- **write** a new markdown cell `Original Study Design` with one paragraph summarizing the original study, as the first section after the title markdown cell.
- **write** a new markdown section `Original Study Design` with one paragraph summarizing the original study
  2. description of your planned modification(s) with rationale(s)
  3. plan for visualizing/comparing/interpreting of results
  4. save as `docs/reports/<name>-analysis-plan.md`, e.g. `docs/reports/holler-analysis-plan.md`
  5. `commit` the plan and `push` to GitHub
  6. this is a small-scale version of a [preregistration](https://www.cos.io/initiatives/prereg)
- **modify** the main methods cell block(s) to note where you will make changes
- **commit** and **push** the changes
- **implement** the change in code
- **interpret** the results of your change(s) in a results & discussion section *and* discuss geographic threats to validity in this study. 
- **conclude** with a statement about how the insights from this reproduction and reanalysis changes how we should interpret the original study results.
- **save** a new study report `html` form. 
- enable **GitHub Pages** on the repository to serve the `html` version of the report to the web.
- **write** a blog post highlighting what you have `learned from` and `contributed to` with this reproduction and reanalysis study. In particular, please address these questions:
  - Keep in mind, a blog post is for **highlights** : aim for a post to be a short and impactful advertisement for the full study... no more than two paragraphs.
  - What have you learned from doing a reproduction study?
  - Has the reproduction deviated from the original study in any way?
  - If so, are the deviations improvements or errors?
  - Are there opportunities to further improve the study's research design, reproducibility, or reproducibility for teaching purposes?
  - Are there opportunities to design meaningful replication studies to further test any theories established by this study?
- **link** to your full study HTML report and GitHub repository from the blog post   

**Note on Style**: Remember that the primary motivation for reproduction and replication studies is not punitive. Frame your discussions in this report and previous reports in the constructive motivation for improving scientific knowledge through peer review. Project like CyberGISX generally, and the Kang et al 2020 publication specifically, are *very new* in geography, and our engagement with them should be both *encouraging* and *constructive* while emphasizing the *value of open science*.
