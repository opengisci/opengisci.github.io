## Discussion / Blog Ideas

Since no reanalysis is due this week, there is a discussion/blog to help think critically about the current problem.
Here are two possibilities to prompt writing:

1. Given what you have seen in our reproductions of social vulnerability models (or similar models of adaptive capacity, resilience, etc.) and read about them, do you think it is important to be able to reproduce them? To replicate them? Why? 
2. Do you have interests in other applications of multi-criteria models? If so, have you learned any important lessons from our reproductions and readings about vulnerability models which can be applied to other applications?
