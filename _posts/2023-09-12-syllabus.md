## Course Description

In this course, we will study geographic information science (GIScience) by reproducing published research with open-source geospatial software. We will debate issues in GIScience by applying critical GIS scholarship, fundamentals of spatial data and analysis, and evidence from our reproduction studies. We will practice open GIScience by collaboratively developing research plans, acquiring and describing spatial data, analyzing and visualizing data with SQL and R, and testing for error and uncertainty. Our research products and results will be published with open science standards in public portfolios. We typically investigate research with themes of human-environment interactions, health, hazards, urban development, and more. These research themes require and integrate social/demographic data, environmental data, and big data.

Prerequisite: GEOG0120 *Human Geography with GIS* or approval based on other experience in geographic analysis.
Programming experience is *not assumed or required*!
You just need to be willing to learn how to translate the spatial analysis that you know from desktop GIS (QGIS, ArcGIS, etc.) into code.

The major emphasis this fall will be learning how to **manage a full GIScience research workflow** in an **open science framework**. Weâ€™ll achieve this through:
- a series of **tutorials**, in key open science practices like using version control and automating research workflows in R or Python.
- **readings** and **debates** about open GIScience
- four **reproduction/reanalysis studies**, in which we will read, repeat, critique, and modify a published GIScience study, producing a reproduction study report.
- one **replication project** in which we will significantly modify a prior study for applications in a new context.

## Learning Goals

-	Become familiar with open science and open source GIS in terms of software/infrastructure, organizations and projects, and radically unique form of knowledge production.
-	Expand your functional knowledge of the nature of geographic information with respect to data standards, structures, metadata, provenance, error, and uncertainty.
-	Apply Open GIScience to address compelling questions in human geography and problems in social and environmental sustainability.
- Gain scientific literacy, including the ability to understand and implement the methods described in published research papers and critically evaluate scientific results and claims.
-	Learn how to reproduce existing geographic research and to produce geographic research that is open, reproducible and replicable.
-	Design and communicate research effectively in multiple media, including digital media, reports, presentations, maps, graphs, tables, data, and code.
-	Become competent and confident in conducting research, learning new methods, and overcoming errors, uncertainty, and technical difficulties.

## Expectations

- **Inclusivity**: Consciously and actively include yourself and others in learning, participation, collaboration, and discussions.
Inclusivity may be achieved through [academic accomodations](https://www.middlebury.edu/office/disability-resource-center/accommodations-and-resources/academic-accommodations) and/or [student resources](https://www.middlebury.edu/office/teaching-learning-research/student-resources) for learning and research.
Accommodations and correspondence about them are confidential.
- **Academic Honesty**: Open source and open science have a different ethos about intellectual property and its value than most of us are accustomed to.
In the first two weeks of class, we will discuss and update our expectations for the [honor code and academic honesty](c-honorcode) in a course focused on open science.
- **Deadlines**: You must always commit the progress that you have made on assignments by the assignment deadline. In case unforeseen challenges or delays have prevented full completion of an assignment, you are required to record the progress that you have made, describe the barrier(s) encountered and anything you have learned about it/them, and propose a solution.
- **End of Semester**: Your body of work for the course must be complete on GitHub Pages by the end of finals week. [Incomplete grades](http://www.middlebury.edu/about/handbook/iv.-policies-for-the-institute/a.-academic-policies/a.6.-grades-credits-and-academic-policies/a.6.e.-incomplete-grades) can only be considered if extreme/unexpected circumstances arise in the final weeks of the semester and if the majority of assignments have already been satisfactorily completed.

## Student Work & Evaluation

Open science requires researchers, universities, and publishers to change the way they value intellectual work and intellectual property, and the same goes for instructors and students.
Traditional means of evaluating and grading student work that are based on individualism, competition, and secrecy are counterproductive to an open science learning environment.

Throughout this course you will develop a set of your own personal pages and repositories on GitHub, containing all of your work for the course. You will receive qualitative feedback on your GitHub portfolio work from peers and from your professor throughout the semester, and you will be given  opportunities to self-evaluate as well. My goal and expectation for your work is that through revision based on feedback, most students should develop a portfolio suitable to show potential employers or graduate schools, earning at least a B+ or A-. Your qualitative feedback throughout the semester serves as your roadmap to this level of achievement. I prefer for us to evaluate your portfolio in whole at the end of the semester for one final grade. However, if there are extenuating circumstances, I can also fall back on a more traditional weighted average of grades for each assignment. Qualities for your work are graded as follows:

Gr | Description
-- | --
A | Work is excellent, complete, and timely. Your work is ready to show to employers or graduate schools. In addition, you have contributed positively to the collective learning and knowledge base of the class.*
A- | Work is excellent, complete, and timely. Your work is ready to show to employers or graduate schools with *very* minor revisions.
B+ | High quality work. Your work is ready to show to parents and friends, and almost ready to show employers or graduate schools&mdash;pending minor revisions.
B | Good work. Your work needs a fair amount of revision to remedy errors and/or full effort to some more cursory components. You could use one more round of feedback and revision before sharing with employers.
B- | Decent work. There are a few significant errors and/or gaps that need addressing before you can share the work with a potential employer.
C's | You have demonstrated learning and intellectual growth, but important components of your GitHub portfolio are not working or in need of complete revisions. C+ needs at least one additional round of feedback prior to sharing work with a potential employer, whereas C or C- may need more.
D | Work is incomplete and/or cursory
F | Not attempted

*There's no public record of your contributions in chats, GroupMe, or similar communication channels. If you're using these, I suggest posting a summary in a GitHub Issue.

If for any reason we need a more traditional weighted grading arrangement, the weights shall be:
- `20%` Quality participation in blog posts, class discussions & debates, and so on
- `20%` 7 Workshop accomplishments illustrated in blogs or short reports
- `60%` 4 Major Labs with reports, of which one is an independent replication or reanalysis study weighted equally with the other three

## Approach to learning

- **Theory** and **context** in which open GIScience research is practiced
- **Introduction** workshop/tutorial to research tools/platforms
- **Study** the research paper and compendium of a GIScience research project
- **Reproduce** the project by acquiring the same data and executing the same procedures
- **Reanalyze** the project by adjusting and improving some components of the research design
- **Replicate** the project by applying it to a new context (thematic, geographic, or temporal)

## Materials & resources

There is no required textbook.

Digital materials will be provided on this site and in other repositories of the [GIS4DEV GitHub Organization](https://github.com/gis4dev), including a private repository for [literature](https://github.com/GIS4DEV/literature).

You must be willing to use a variety of free software and apply for/subscribe to a variety of free internet-based services, listed below.
We will not install or sign up for all of these programs/services at once, but please attempt to get each one running quickly as you are prompted throughout the semester, so that we have ample time to troubleshoot or find alternative solutions.
**Remember all of your passwords**

## General Expectations for Reproduction/Reanalysis Studies

- Complete a research compendium (a GitHub repository) for each analysis. We'll have specific training on this.
- Write up a summary and interpretation of the analysis.
- Include methods documentation to support full reproducibility.
This is most easily achieved by having legible code with good comments.
- Visualize results with maps and/or graphs.
- Interpret results with support of references to class readings.

## Expectations for blog posts

In weeks in which no lab is due, please write a short blog post reflecting on new class content (readings, discussions, activities, workshops) connecting them to their significance for you, in terms of any internships, independent research, other courses, personal experience, or career aspirations you may have. You could also take a less personal perspective by connecting content to relevant current events and societal / environmental issues. The most straightforward approach to organizing a blog post is in response to any of the discussion prompts from that week. To facilitate class activities, some weeks will include more specific direction for the week's post.

The timing of this is flexible: you could reflect on readings prior to a class meeting about them, or extend the in-class discussions afterward. Post your thoughts by Tuesday of the following week.

Posts should include references to relevant readings by listing them at the end (similar to how I have done in this course site) and linking to their DOI, if one is available.
