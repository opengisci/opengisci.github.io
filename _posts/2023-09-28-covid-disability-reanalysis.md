The purpose of this lab is to reanalyze Chakraborty (2021) and finalize a reproduction report.

## Procedure

- **identify** an error, uncertain decision, or opportunity for improving reproducibility or study design
- **write** an plan for modifications in markdown, including
  1. title and author (yourself)
  2. description of modification(s) with rationale(s)
  3. plan for visualizing/comparing/interpreting of results
- **modify** the analysis plan to address the issue identified above
- **implement** the change in code
- **interpret** the results of your change(s) in the `rmarkdown` report
- **knit** a new study report in `pdf` and `html` forms
- enable **GitHub Pages** on the repository to serve the `html` version of the report to the web
- **write** a blog post highlighting what you have `learned from` and `contributed to` with this reproduction and reanalysis study. In particular, please address these questions:
  - Has the reproduction deviated from the original study in any way?
  - If so, are the deviations improvements or errors?
  - Are there opportunities to further improve the study's research design, reproducibility, or reproducibility for teaching purposes?
  - Are there opportunities to design meaningful replication studies to further test any theories established by this study?

## Timeline

- Thursday, September 28 Class: Draft analysis plan of proposed changes and plans for interpreting the changes
- Thursday, September 28 Lab: Finalize analysis plan and commit the plan to GitHub
- Before Thursday, October 5 Lab: Commit finalized analysis report and blog post to GitHub

## Suggested markdown for analysis plan

```markdown
# Planned revisions to reproduction of ....

Author: First name, Last name

## Analysis

Enumerate and justify changes to analytical plan here

## Results

Describe how changes will be visualized / compared here

## Discussion

Describe how you will interpret the results of your changes here.
For example, in hypothetical terms, if my new/revised map shows ---, it will mean that ---.
