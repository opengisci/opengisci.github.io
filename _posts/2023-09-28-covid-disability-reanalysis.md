The purpose of this lab is to reanalyze Chakraborty (2021) and finalize a reproduction report.

## Procedure

- **identify** an error, uncertain decision, or opportunity for improving reproducibility or study design
- **modify** the analysis plan to address the issue identified above, including plans for visualizing/comparing/interpreting results of the change
- **implement** the change in code
- **interpret** the results of your change(s) in the `rmarkdown` report
- **knit** a new study report in `pdf` and `html` forms
- **write** a blog post highlighting what you have `learned from` and `contributed to` with this reproduction and reanalysis study. In particular, please address these questions:
  - Has the reproduction deviated from the original study in any way?
  - If so, are the deviations improvements or errors?
  - Are there opportunities to further improve the study's research design, reproducibility, or reproducibility for teaching purposes?
  - Are there opportunities to design meaningful replication studies to further test any theories established by this study?
