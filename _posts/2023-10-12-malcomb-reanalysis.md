The purpose of this lab is to:

- choose a parameter or set of interdependent parameters of the Malcomb et al climate vulnerability model for Malawi which represents a subjective researcher decision

- test the vulnerability model's robustness to the change
- visualize and interpret your results in the context of theory on error and uncertainty in spatial models in general and vulnerability models in particular
