We will take this meeting time to review one another's work in the course thus far.
Individual feedback will be provided in the course [Google Drive Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1PjSrI5PW_E6A0Ddf9Eq19yKDGSVsYesX)

## Overall Site

- Is there a good main page, raising interest in both the person (as a potential employeeâ€¦) and the content (evidence of an intellectual GIS maverick?)
- Is the site functional with working links and easy navigation?
- Is the site following an honor code of sharing, reproducibility, and attribution of work?

## Blog Posts

- There are *three* discussion blog posts so far:
  - Week 1: Science / GIS discourse
  - Week 2: Open Source GIS / Reproducibility
  - Week 5: Error / Uncertainty

There are *two* blog posts advertising your reproduction studies so far:
  - Chakraborty
  - Malcomb et al (due this week)

- Do posts cite appropriate readings?
- Is any proofreading / revision necessary?
- Does the most misinterpret anything from the reading, or miss something important for the argument being made?
- Are posts related to a workshop activity using data for that workshop and linking to relevant repositories?

## Reproduction/Replication Studies

- There are *two* studies thus far:
  - Chakraborty
  - Malcomb et al (due this week)

- Do each of the studies have a post highlighting interesting findings from the report?
- Have each of the studies been published with a Git repository?
- Does each study's post link to full report and research compendium/repository?
- For each study, is there clear and legible:
  - purpose
  - methodology
  - data availability and metadata / data citations
  - code
  - visualization of results
  - interpretation of results in relation to relevant course readings?
- Can any steps be taken to improve reproducibility of the study?
