## Tutorial

- In class orientation to RStudio **replacing with video playlist**
- [R for Geospatial Processing workshop](https://bakaniko.github.io/FOSS4G2019_Geoprocessing_with_R_workshop/) presented by Nicolas Roelandt in Bucharest, Romania. Here's the [repository](https://github.com/Bakaniko/FOSS4G2019_Geoprocessing_with_R_workshop)

## Software

- Base R: [R project for statistical computing](https://www.r-project.org/)
- RStudio: [posit downloads](https://posit.co/downloads/)

## Essential packages

- [groundhog](https://groundhogr.com/) for reproducible computational environments (consistent versions of R and its packages)
- [here](https://here.r-lib.org/) for reproducible path names
- [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) includes [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) for database-style data frames
- [sf](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) provides support for spatial vector data implementing the OSGeo *simple features*  standards we are accustomed to
- [stars](https://r-spatial.github.io/stars/) spatial-temporal raster data in R
- [tmap](https://r-tmap.github.io/tmap/) thematic maps, including static maps or interactive leaflet maps

### Alternative packages

- [sp](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sp) alternative package for spatial vector data
- [raster](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/raster) alternative raster data package
- [mapsf](https://riatelab.github.io/mapsf/) alternative for static map cartography mapsf [presentation slides with vignettes](https://rcarto.github.io/user2021)
