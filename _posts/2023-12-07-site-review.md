We will take this meeting time to review one another's work in the course thus far.

We will also have an opportunity to address any specific challenges arising with projects, based on Thursday's lab section or questions on the discussion forum.

### Overall Site

- Is there a good main page, raising interest in both the person (as a potential employeeâ€¦) and the content (evidence of an intellectual GIS maverick?)
- Is the site functional with working links and easy navigation?
- Is the site following an honor code of sharing, reproducibility, and attribution of work?

### Blog Posts

- There are *four* posts:
  - What is Open GIScience?
  - Open Source GIS & Reproducibility
  - Error & Uncertainty
  - Geographic threats to validity in your project

- Do posts cite appropriate readings?
- Is any proofreading / revision necessary?
- Does the most misinterpret anything from the reading, or miss something important for the argument being made?
- Are posts related to a workshop activity using data for that workshop and linking to relevant repositories?

### Labs

- There are *four* labs:
  - Chakraborty
  - Malcomb et al
  - Spielman et al
  - Kang et al

- Have each of the lab analyses been published with a Git repository?
- Do each of the lab have a post with interesting findings from the lab report?
- Does each lab post link to the lab's research compendium/repository?
- For each lab, is there clear and legible:
  - purpose
  - methodology
  - data availability and metadata / data citations
  - code
  - visualization of results
  - interpretation of results in relation to relevant course readings?
