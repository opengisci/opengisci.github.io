- Please structure your final project using the [template for reproducible research](https://github.com/HEGSRR/HEGSRR-Template)
- Many of your replications/reproductions will use existing data and code provided by the authors, but you'll likely find that you can increase the reproducibility of their study by reorganizing it into the template format and ensuring that all the proper metadata is included.

## Due Dates

Both projects and finalized GitHub portfolios are due at the conclusion of finals: `Friday December 17`
