There are no planned activities during this lecture due to conflicts with the [I-GUIDE Forum](https://iguide.illinois.edu/forum-2023/).

I will share the paper and slides to be presented here!

Missing this lecture is balanced out by the time spent on tutorials in spatial R and spatial Python.

You *are* expected to attend lab and work collaboratively on reproducing the Malcomb et al study.
