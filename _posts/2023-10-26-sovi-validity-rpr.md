Reproduce Spielman et al.'s replication of the SoVI and validity checks.

The reproduction study can be found here: <https://github.com/HEGSRR/RPl-Spielman-2020>

A discussion thread about the study can be found [here](https://github.com/opengisci/FA23/discussions/4) 

Let's all attempt a common *reanalysis* strategy for this paper. 
We will adjust the SoVI construction to *weight* the SoVI components by the percentage of variance they explain.
