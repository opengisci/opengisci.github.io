## Finalizing and registering the plan

Whereas professional researchers register their analysis plans on services like [OSF](https://osf.io/registries) or [AsPredicted](https://aspredicted.org/), some researchers have also suggested simply committing a released version of a git compendium repository once the analysis plan is complete and prior to data collection.
This is the approach we will take in this course: committing and releasing a version of the research compendium with the completed analysis plan prior to collecting and analyzing data.
