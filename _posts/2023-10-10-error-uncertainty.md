## Reading

Recall that the NASEM (2019) report chapter 3 included some discussion of *error*, *precision*, and *uncertainty*.

## Discussion / Blog Post

I am particularly interested in your interpretation and reaction to figure 6.1 in Longley et al (2008) with regards to the three questions/prompts below:
1. Do you have first-hand knowledge or experience with uncertainty in spatial/geographic research?
1. What responsibilities do geographers have with regards to uncertainty in research?
1. What strategies might geographers use to fulfill those responsibilities?

You could also use this blog post as a way to start synthesizing your observations from the Malcomb et al study by discussing sources of uncertainty in that study *vis a vis* figure 6.1 in Longley et al (2008).

   - I suggest starting at the end of this paper, with the pragmatic *Where are database ethnographies needed?* section; then the first three subsections of *Literatures that bear on database ethnographies*: The proliferation of boundary objects, semantic data interoperability, and the role of tacit knowledge in scientific communities.
